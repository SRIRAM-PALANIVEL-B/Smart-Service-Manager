        Enterprise Automation / Service Operations

üß≠ Problem Statement
        
        Design and develop a menu-based Python CLI application that manages service operations using modular programming principles. The system must support:

                    1. Creating and managing customer records
                    2. Logging and tracking support tickets
3. Generating service summary reports
4. Sending email alerts for overdue or critical tickets
5. Providing a unified CLI dashboard for user interaction
The system will be built using OOP principles, with individual modules owned and developed by different contributors, and integrated via a shared GitHub workflow.
üß≠ Approach
1. CLI Interface with Menu System
The dashboard will serve as a navigation panel to access all modules:
ÔÇ∑ Manage Customers
ÔÇ∑ Manage Tickets
ÔÇ∑ Generate Reports
ÔÇ∑ Send Alerts
ÔÇ∑ Exit
Each option routes to a separate Python class/module using imports and function calls.
2. Customer Data Management
ÔÇ∑ Uses classes to define Customer entities.
ÔÇ∑ Stores customer data in a JSON file.
ÔÇ∑ Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
ÔÇ∑ Search by ID or email.
3. Service Ticket Tracker
ÔÇ∑ Define a Ticket class linked to a customer.
ÔÇ∑ Stores ticket info: issue, date, status, priority.
ÔÇ∑ Track ticket updates and status transitions.
ÔÇ∑ Stores data in CSV or JSON format.
4. Email Notification Module
ÔÇ∑ Sends email reminders for open/overdue tickets.
ÔÇ∑ Uses smtplib or yagmail for secure email handling.
ÔÇ∑ Schedules and triggers alerts using Python logic.
5. Reporting Module
ÔÇ∑ Reads customer and ticket data.
ÔÇ∑ Calculates: open tickets per customer, resolution stats, top issues.
ÔÇ∑ Optional: Use pandas for easier CSV handling.
ÔÇ∑ Exports summary to CSV.
6. Integration Dashboard
ÔÇ∑ One CLI file to tie all modules.
ÔÇ∑ Uses try-except and user-friendly prompts.
ÔÇ∑ Maintains logs or status messages.
